  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I spent years building tools, teams, and products at the intersection of data and user experience. These days I spend my time exploring — with AI, with design, with systems that try to make sense of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve launched a photography site (<a href="https://www.gloriouslens.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glorious Lens</a>), published a few playful books, built an interactive peyote bead stich editor, and a system that automates pickleball tournament reporting in real time. I’m fascinated by what happens when large language models become collaborators in creative, analytical, and even spiritual work (I'm a meditator).

  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been building my own research assistant: a system that pulls from the torrent of AI news, compares it to my own notes, and helps me follow emergent themes. It's a hybrid of feeds, embeddings, SQLite, and stubborn curiosity. You can see its exploratory graph view <a href="https://research-gopher.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

  <p>
    I like clean typography, fast prototypes, minimalism with a sense of humor, and finding elegant structure in messy systems. I’m also prone to rewriting things long after they work, just to make them feel right.
  </p>

  <p>
    I live in Florida, play pickleball, and ask a lot of questions.
