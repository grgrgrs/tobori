When I was working as an analytics consultant for the head of Florida Medicaid operations we met with her staff to discuss a major initiative fraught with unknowns. After some confused discussion she ended the meeting saying "We're doing X." After the meeting I expressed appreciation for her decisiveness. She said "I don't know if we're doing exactly the right thing, but you can't steer a parked car."

That was more than 20 years ago, and not a month goes by that I don't think of it. From deciding whether to exercise or starting a new garden bed or committing to developing some new software, it is a touchstone. I don't have to have all the answers. I don't have to know how things will turn out. I can't. That's not how life works, and it would be boring if it did.

So I accept the uncertainty, trust in my instincts, start the engine and put the car in gear. There will be turns and stops and starts along the way. But I'll get somewhere. I know I need to start moving and live the journey. How it goes and where it ends is usually unexpected. But it's always rewarding, in its way.

So today I'm starting a blog. After debating it, considering options, questioning my motivation and ability, and trying to imagine where it would go. This morning as I was sitting in my parked car researching options I read this post [unsolicited blogging advice]([Unsolicited blogging advice â€“ Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/unsolicited-blogging-advice)), took a walk, came back and put the car in gear. Off I go.
