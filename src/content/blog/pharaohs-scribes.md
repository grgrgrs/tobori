Years ago, I worked with a group of environmental scientists at the Savannah River Site—once a key facility for nuclear materials. While the location wasn’t my favorite, the team of environmental scientists was top-notch: smart, curious, and eager to dive into the data.

Our job was to help them access the constantly updated datasets tracking everything from soil chemistry to bird populations. At the time, getting this data wasn’t easy. It lived behind locked doors—databases tended by the chosen few. Scientists had to request the data they needed and wait, often for days, while the "keepers of the code" performed their magic.

We built a system that merged and hosted the data on a (then cutting-edge) Apple Macintosh server, with interactive clients that let the scientists search, filter, and visualize data themselves. Simple, really. Right time, right place. But to the scientists, it was transformative.

One of them—Jim B.—became an outspoken champion of our work. At a conference, he told the story of how we’d liberated them from _“Pharaoh’s Scribes”_—a term he used to describe the old world of hoarded knowledge, where access to information was controlled by a few and withheld from the many. He said it with fire, almost spitting the words, resenting the power those gatekeepers had once held.

Fast forward to today.

As I work with AI tools in building systems like [Tobori.ai](https://www.tobori.ai), I feel that same sense of liberation. I’m building things solo that would’ve required a team just a few years ago—coding, UI design, data modeling, deployment. My cohort of AI assistants is always on call.

And I think of Jim. I think of his Pharaoh’s Scribes.

Today, those scribes look a little different—perhaps cloaked in the arcane traditions of compilers, syntax rules, or deep platform APIs. But their gatekeeping power is fading. Not because their knowledge isn’t valuable—it absolutely is—but because AI has put that knowledge within reach of many more people. The balance is shifting—from those who know, to those who imagine.

We’re entering an era where ideas, not credentials, drive creation. And the question is no longer, “Who holds the knowledge?” but “Who will do something with it?”
