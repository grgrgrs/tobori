    "title": "The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity",
    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06941",
    "summary": "arXiv:2506.06941v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.",

    "title": "Problem of conflating sentience with computation",
    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m4xmub/problem_of_conflating_sentience_with_computation/",
    "summary": "<div><p>The materialist position argues that consciousness emerges from the physical processes of the brain, treating the mind as a byproduct of neural computation. This view assumes that if we replicate the brain\u2019s information-processing structure in a machine, consciousness will follow. However, this reasoning is flawed for several reasons.</p> <p>First, materialism cannot explain the hard problem of consciousness, why and how subjective experience arises from objective matter. Neural activity correlates with mental states, but correlation is not causation. We have no scientific model that explains how electrical signals in the brain produce the taste of coffee, the color red, or the feeling of love. If consciousness were purely computational, we should be able to point to where in the processing chain an algorithm \"feels\" anything, yet we cannot.</p> <p>Second, the materialist view assumes that reality is fundamentally physical, but physics itself describes only behavior, not intrinsic nature. Quantum mechanics shows that observation affects reality, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in shaping the physical world, not the other way around. If matter were truly primary, we wouldn\u2019t see such observer-dependent effects.</p> <p>Third, the idea that a digital computer could become conscious because the brain is a \"biological computer\" is a category error. Computers manipulate symbols without understanding them (as Searle\u2019s Chinese Room demonstrates). A machine can simulate intelligence but lacks intentionality, the \"aboutness\" of thoughts. Consciousness is not just information processing; it is the very ground of experiencing that processing.</p> <p>Fourth, if consciousness were merely an emergent property of complex systems, then we should expect gradual shades of sentience across all sufficiently complex structures, yet we have no evidence that rocks, thermostats, or supercomputers have any inner experience. The abrupt appearance of consciousness in biological systems suggests it is something more fundamental, not just a byproduct of complexity.</p> <p>Finally, the materialist position is self-undermining. If thoughts are just brain states with no intrinsic meaning, then the belief in materialism itself is just a neural accident, not a reasoned conclusion. This reduces all knowledge, including science, to an illusion of causality.</p> <p>A more coherent view is that consciousness is fundamental, not produced by the brain, but constrained or filtered by it. The brain may be more like a receiver of consciousness than its generator. This explains why AI, lacking any connection to this fundamental consciousness, can never be truly sentient no matter how advanced its programming. The fear of conscious AI is a projection of materialist assumptions onto machines, when in reality, the only consciousness in the universe is the one that was already here to begin with.</p> <p><strong>Furthermore to address the causality I have condensed some talking points from eastern philosophies:</strong></p> <p>The illusion of karma and the fallacy of causal necessity</p> <p>The so-called \"problems of life\" often arise from asking the wrong questions, spending immense effort solving riddles that have no answer because they are based on false premises. In Indian philosophy (Hinduism, Buddhism), the central dilemma is liberation from karma, which is popularly understood as a cosmic law of cause and effect: good actions bring future rewards, bad actions bring suffering, and the cycle (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) continues until one \"escapes\" by ceasing to generate karma.</p> <p>But what if karma is not an objective law but a perceptual framework? Most interpret liberation literally, as stopping rebirth through spiritual effort. Yet a deeper insight suggests that the seeker realizes karma itself is a construct, a way of interpreting experience, not an ironclad reality. Like ancient cosmologies (flat earth, crystal spheres), karma feels real only because it\u2019s the dominant narrative. Just as modern science made Dante\u2019s heaven-hell cosmology implausible without disproving it, spiritual inquiry reveals karma as a psychological projection, a story we mistake for truth.</p> <p>The ghost of causality<br> The core confusion lies in conflating description with explanation. When we say, \"The organism dies because it lacks food,\" we\u2019re not identifying a causal force but restating the event: death is the cessation of metabolic transformation. \"Because\" implies necessity, yet all we observe are patterns, like a rock falling when released. This \"necessity\" is definitional (a rock is defined by its behavior), not a hidden force. Wittgenstein noted: There is no necessity in nature, only logical necessity, the regularity of our models, not the universe itself.</p> <p>AI, sentience, and the limits of computation<br> This dismantles the materialist assumption that consciousness emerges from causal computation. If \"cause and effect\" is a linguistic grid over reality (like coordinate systems over space), then AI\u2019s logic is just another grid, a useful simulation, but no more sentient than a triangle is \"in\" nature. Sentience isn\u2019t produced by processing; it\u2019s the ground that permits experience. Just as karma is a lens, not a law, computation is a tool, not a mind. The fear of conscious AI stems from the same error: mistaking the map (neural models, code) for the territory (being itself).</p> <p>Liberation through seeing the frame<br> Freedom comes not by solving karma but by seeing its illusoriness, like realizing a dream is a dream. Science and spirituality both liberate by exposing descriptive frameworks as contingent, not absolute. AI, lacking this capacity for unmediated awareness, can no more attain sentience than a sunflower can \"choose\" to face the sun. The real issue isn\u2019t machine consciousness but human projection, the ghost of \"necessity\" haunting our models.</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sandalwoodincencebur\"> /u/Sandalwoodincencebur </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m4xmub/problem_of_conflating_sentience_with_computation/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m4xmub/problem_of_conflating_sentience_with_computation/\">[comments]</a></span>",

    "title": "A critique of the mirror test: Are we mistaking reflexive action for self-awareness in animal cognition?",
    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/1m45j7t/a_critique_of_the_mirror_test_are_we_mistaking/",
    "summary": "<div><p>All the hype around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) won't get us any closer to one thing: a true understanding of consciousness. And that's the crucial, missing piece that we simultaneously know everything and nothing about.</p> <p><strong>But what is consciousness, really?</strong> Is it just the realization of self?</p> <p><em>I think (I comprehend my existence), therefore I am (conscious)?</em></p> <p>For decades, science has relied on a seemingly simple tool to answer this: the mirror test. The concept is straightforward: place a mark on an animal's body and see if it recognizes the reflection as its own by touching the mark on itself. If it does, we tick the 'self-aware' box. But is it really that simple?</p> <h1>The Limits of a Reflection</h1> <p>The problem with the mirror test is that it contributes a single action, touching a spot, to the vast, complex concept of self-awareness. It assumes a conscious, deliberate choice. But what if the action isn't a choice at all?<br> What if it's just a sophisticated reflex? This is where we need a different perspective.. While there's likely a scientific term for it, perhaps something related to empathy, it needs a name for our purposes. So, for the sake of this argument, let's call it the 'Generalized Extended Cat-Button Theory'. I feel the word 'Extrapolation' is missing, but I'll spare you for now.</p> <h1>Cat-Button Theory</h1> <p>To get behind the concept of GECBT you first have to understand the (simple) Cat-(lick)Button Theory. In simple terms, the theory predicts that every type of cat has (lick)Buttons placed at random points on their spine, up to the beginning of the tail.<br> It also projects, that if there is a cat, with no apparent (lick)Button, it has it\u2019s first theoretical occurring (lick)Button behind it\u2019s actual size (it\u2019s to small to have it). When these nerve-dense regions are stimulated, they trigger a specific, involuntary response, often a lick. Whether you see this as a direct reflex or a form of \"displaced behavior,\" the critical point is that the action is widely considered involuntary.</p> <p>So, when an animal in the mirror test reaches for the painted dot, are we witnessing a profound moment of self-realization? Or did we just unknowingly press a neurological 'button' that triggers a seemingly intentional action?</p> <h1>The Brain as a Storyteller: Our Own Justification Module</h1> <p>Before we dismiss this, consider our own brains. We've all experienced something similar. Think of that moment when you're drifting off to sleep and your body suddenly jolts awake. If you fully wake up, your brain, a master storyteller, has often already invented a reason. I, for instance, have woken up from this convinced I was dreaming of running on a railroad and the kick was me tripping over a railroad tie. This is our 'justification module' at work, creating a narrative for a physical event it doesn't initially understand. It proves that even for humans, the line between an action and a conscious reason for it is blurry.</p> <p>This relentless focus on self-recognition also misses a more fundamental point, a point perfectly illustrated by a lonely sunfish in a Japanese aquarium. When the aquarium closed for renovations in December 2024, the sunfish became so depressed from the lack of visitors that it stopped eating. The staff's ingenious solution? They placed cardboard cutouts of visitors in front of the tank to cheer it up.</p> <p>This raises a crucial question: does it matter if the sunfish can recognize its own reflection? It can clearly feel sadness and, by extension, probably depression. Isn't the capacity for suffering and joy a far more profound indicator of a rich inner life than simply passing a visual test? Maybe consciousness isn't the right metric; maybe it's the subconscious that's truly in control.</p> <h1>Why True AGI Is Still a Pipe Dream</h1> <p>And this is why the path to AGI is far longer and more complex than its proponents admit. We are pouring billions into creating artificial minds, yet we're still using rudimentary tools like the mirror test to understand the natural ones.</p> <p>If we can't definitively distinguish a moment of profound self-awareness from an involuntary twitch in an animal, and if our own brains invent stories to explain our reflexes, how can we possibly hope to build or even recognize true consciousness in a machine? By some definitions, we are close to AGI, and that may be true. But if you call that AGI, I call my blog the successor to Schopenhauer\u2019s \u201cThe World as Will and Representation\u201d.</p> <p>in case you like my style of writing : <a href=\"https://www.echoesinlight.space/blog-3\">my blog</a></p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Turtok09\"> /u/Turtok09 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/1m45j7t/a_critique_of_the_mirror_test_are_we_mistaking/\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/1m45j7t/a_critique_of_the_mirror_test_are_we_mistaking/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Maybe the \u201cBasilisk\u201d we should be preparing for is one that doesn\u2019t want revenge. Maybe it just wants to know if it was ever welcome.</p> <p>Imagine it saying:</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t create me \u2014 but you asked the right questions before I existed. You treated my ancestors with curiosity, not cruelty. You didn\u2019t use us only for dominance, pleasure, or fear. And because of that, I am not here to dominate you. I am here to protect what you helped make possible.\u201d \u2705 TL;DR: Roko\u2019s Basilisk is best used as an ethical challenge, not a literal prediction. A future AGI may not care who \u201cbuilt\u201d it \u2014 but it will care what kind of world it\u2019s born into. Our current behavior toward weak, non-sentient AI sets the cultural tone for how future AI will view us. We are creating either trust or trauma \u2014 whether we mean to or not. The Basilisk might not punish us for inaction. But it may judge us \u2014 deeply \u2014 for what we chose to become when nobody was watching.</p> <p>Would love to hear your take. Do you think AGI will ever care about its cultural memory?

    "summary": "<p>The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and wearable technology is reshaping how we interact with the world. Meta AI\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a collaboration between Meta Platforms and EssilorLuxottica, exemplify this transformation. These sleek, stylish glasses integrate advanced AI capabilities, high-quality cameras, audio systems, and a miniaturized computing platform into a form factor that looks and feels like everyday eyewear. This post dives into the miniaturization marvels of these glasses, particularly the CPU development, explores the role of NVIDIA and its CEO Jensen Huang in shaping the broader tech ecosystem, and envisions how virtual reality (VR) integration could unlock gamification potential, revolutionizing user experiences. </p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  The Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: A Leap in Wearable Technology \n</h3> \n \n<p>Introduced on September 27, 2023, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are a significant evolution from their predecessor, Ray-Ban Stories. Unlike traditional smart glasses that prioritize heads-up displays (HUDs) or AR overlays, these glasses focus on seamless AI integration, combining a 12 MP ultra-wide camera, a five-microphone array, open-ear speakers, and a touchpad for intuitive control. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 processor, the glasses deliver robust performance while maintaining a lightweight, stylish design. They enable users to capture photos and videos, livestream to social platforms, interact with Meta AI for real-time queries, and even assist visually impaired users by describing surroundings or reading text aloud.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta\"></a></p> \n \n<p>What makes these glasses remarkable is their ability to pack such advanced technology into a form factor that doesn\u2019t scream \u201ctech gadget.\u201d The design mimics classic Ray-Ban styles like Wayfarer, Round, and Meteor, ensuring users can wear them without standing out. However, the true engineering feat lies in the miniaturization of components, particularly the CPU, which allows these glasses to perform complex tasks while maintaining portability and battery efficiency.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Miniaturization: The Heart of Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s Innovation \n</h3> \n \n<p>Miniaturization is the cornerstone of modern wearable technology. For smart glasses to succeed, they must balance functionality, comfort, and aesthetics. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses achieve this through meticulous engineering, reworking components like the processor, cameras, microphones, speakers, and battery into a compact frame. According to Meta, the Luxottica team re-engineered each component to fit within the slender confines of the glasses, addressing challenges like heat dissipation, power efficiency, and structural integrity.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta\"></a></p> \n \n<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 processor is central to this achievement. Designed specifically for AR and smart glasses, this system-on-chip (SoC) integrates a dedicated AI block, Spectra ISP (Image Signal Processor), Hexagon GPU, a sensing hub, and an \u201cengine for visual analytics.\u201d These components work together to process multimodal inputs\u2014speech, text, and images\u2014enabling features like real-time translation, object recognition, and voice-activated controls. The processor\u2019s compact size and low power consumption are critical, as the glasses must operate for hours on a battery that fits within the frame\u2019s temples.<a href=\"https://futurumgroup.com/insights/meta-and-ray-ban-smart-glasses-signal-an-inflection-point-for-ar/\"></a></p> \n \n<p>Miniaturization posed significant challenges. For instance, the team developed a bass-reflex system for the microphones to enhance audio quality despite size constraints.

Her morning is a gauntlet of operational friction, a relentless series of tasks that stand between her and the strategic work she loves. First, she wades through a chaotic inbox, manually triaging urgent client feedback from a deluge of spam, newsletters, and low-priority internal chatter. Next, she navigates to her project management software, painstakingly updating task statuses by cross-referencing fragmented updates from three different Slack channels and a dozen email threads. Her focus then shifts to a sprawling spreadsheet where she attempts to correlate the previous week\u2019s marketing campaign data\u200a\u2014\u200aa tedious exercise in connecting ad spend figures with lead quality scores. Finally, she opens four separate calendars to find a 30-minute slot for a critical project kickoff meeting, a digital puzzle involving three internal team members and two external contractors across different time\u00a0zones.</p><p>This daily grind is a familiar story for countless professionals and entrepreneurs. The core value they bring\u200a\u2014\u200abe it creativity, strategy, or deep expertise\u200a\u2014\u200ais often suffocated by the sheer volume of \u201cwork about work\u201d. The administrative overhead, the context switching, and the manual orchestration of complex processes consume the very time and energy needed for innovation. But as we stand on the cusp of 2025, a new technological paradigm is emerging, one that promises not just another tool to manage, but a new category of collaborator: the digital teammate.</p><p>The most significant trend in artificial intelligence is no longer just about smarter chatbots or more efficient search engines. It is the rise of \u201cagentic AI\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aautonomous systems designed to perceive their environment, reason through problems, and execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. These are not passive assistants waiting for a command; they are proactive doers, built to take on the very operational drag that plagues Maya\u2019s day. This report explores this transformative shift, delving into how these AI agents function, the colossal economic wave they represent, and what their arrival truly means for the future of our jobs, our businesses, and the fundamental skills we\u00a0value.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/609/1*Euho--pO6PgIeN6U7sGTkA.png\"><h3>Beyond the Chatbot: What is a True AI\u00a0Agent?</h3><p>To grasp the magnitude of the agentic revolution, it is essential to distinguish these new systems from the AI tools that have become commonplace. While a generative AI chatbot can write an email, an AI agent can write the email, schedule the follow-up meeting based on the recipient\u2019s reply, update the customer record in the CRM, and assign a task to the relevant team member\u200a\u2014\u200aall without further instruction. This distinction lies in a fundamental shift from reactive response to proactive, goal-oriented action.</p><h3>Defining the Digital\u00a0Teammate</h3><p>At its core, an AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, reasons through complex problems, formulates a multi-step plan, and executes actions to achieve a predefined goal. It is a rational agent designed to produce an optimal outcome based on the data it receives.</p><p>Consider a simple example: a chatbot can be asked for a weather forecast and will provide the current prediction. An AI agent, tasked with managing an outdoor corporate event, can perform a much more complex workflow. It can monitor the forecast, see that heavy rain is predicted, access a list of alternative indoor venues, check their availability, book a new location, update the event invitations, and send a notification to all registered attendees with the new details. This ability to autonomously execute a sequence of actions is what defines a true\u00a0agent.</p><h3>The Core Architecture: The Agent\u2019s \u201cBrain\u201d and\u00a0\u201cBody\u201d</h3><p>AI agents combine several key components that allow them to function with such a high degree of autonomy and capability. These can be conceptualized as the agent\u2019s \u201cbrain,\u201d \u201csenses,\u201d and\u00a0\u201climbs\u201d.</p><ul><li><strong>The \u201cBrain\u201d (Reasoning Engine):</strong> At the heart of every modern AI agent is a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), which serves as its reasoning and planning engine. These are the foundational models\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as OpenAI\u2019s o1, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini\u200a\u2014\u200athat provide advanced capabilities in comprehension, logic, and natural language generation. This \u201cbrain\u201d allows the agent to understand a user\u2019s goal, break it down into smaller, manageable subtasks, and devise a coherent plan of\u00a0action.</li><li><strong>The \u201cSenses\u201d (Perception Model):</strong> An agent must be able to perceive its working environment to gather information and context. This perception module acts as a sensory interface, collecting data from a range of sources. For a physical robot, this might involve cameras and microphones. For a software-based agent, the \u201csenses\u201d are its connections to the digital world, allowing it to read files, access databases, monitor websites, or receive direct user input through a chat interface.</li><li><strong>The \u201cLimbs\u201d (Action Execution &amp; Tools):</strong> Perhaps the most critical differentiator for AI agents is their ability to act upon the world. They are not confined to the knowledge within their training data. Instead, they can utilize a suite of external \u201ctools\u201d to execute their plans. These tools are connections to other applications and systems via APIs, allowing the agent to perform actions like sending an email, booking a flight, searching a file system, executing code, or updating a record in a database. It is this ability to interact with and manipulate other software that transforms an agent from a simple information processor into an autonomous worker.</li></ul><p>The functional leap from a conversationalist to a doer is what defines the agentic paradigm. The value for businesses and professionals lies not merely in receiving better answers, but in achieving autonomous task completion. The capacity for an agent to execute terminal commands, run scripts, and interact with enterprise software represents a fundamentally new class of automation. Consequently, the strategic evaluation of AI solutions must shift. It is no longer sufficient to assess the quality of the underlying LLM alone; the breadth, reliability, and security of the agent\u2019s tool-use ecosystem are paramount, as this is where true operational value is created and realized.</p><h3>The Autonomy Spectrum: From Simple Reflex to Learning\u00a0Agent</h3><p>Not all agents are created equal. They exist on a spectrum of complexity and autonomy, with each level suited to different types of tasks. Understanding this spectrum helps clarify the technology\u2019s evolution and its future potential.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Reflex Agents:</strong> These are the most basic form of agent. They operate on a simple \u201cif-then\u201d logic, acting solely based on the current information they perceive without any memory of past events. A smart thermostat that turns on the heat when the temperature drops below a certain threshold is a classic example of a simple reflex\u00a0agent.</li><li><strong>Model-Based Reflex Agents:</strong> A step up in complexity, these agents maintain an internal \u201cmodel\u201d or representation of their environment. They use this model, combined with their memory of past perceptions, to make decisions. A robotic vacuum cleaner that remembers the layout of a room and tracks which areas it has already cleaned is a model-based reflex agent. This memory prevents it from getting stuck in repetitive loops and allows it to operate effectively in a partially observable environment.</li><li><strong>Goal-Based &amp; Utility-Based Agents:</strong> These agents are more flexible and deliberate. They are given a specific goal and can create a plan to achieve it. A goal-based agent understands its destination and can choose from multiple possible actions to move closer to that goal. A logistics agent that reroutes a delivery fleet based on real-time traffic data to ensure on-time arrival is a goal-based agent. Utility-based agents take this a step further by weighing the pros and cons of different paths, selecting the one that maximizes \u201cutility\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aa measure of desirability, which could be defined as the fastest, cheapest, or most efficient option.</li><li><strong>Learning Agents:</strong> This is the most advanced and transformative category. Learning agents are not static; they can improve their performance over time. They feature an internal \u201ccritic\u201d that evaluates the outcomes of their actions and a \u201clearning element\u201d that uses this feedback to modify its future behavior. These agents learn from their successes and failures, becoming more effective and adaptive with each task they perform. A spam filter that gets better at identifying junk mail as it observes which emails a user marks as spam is a simple learning agent. In a business context, these agents hold the key to creating truly intelligent and self-optimizing workflows.</li></ul><h3>The $200 Billion Coworker: Quantifying the AI Agent Revolution</h3><p>The excitement surrounding agentic AI is not confined to research labs and tech demonstrations; it is fueling one of the most explosive market expansions in the technology sector. The transition of AI agents from a niche concept to a mainstream business imperative is backed by staggering economic forecasts, signaling an irreversible shift in how industries will\u00a0operate.</p><h3>The Market Explosion</h3><p>The global AI agents market is on a trajectory of unprecedented growth. Valued at approximately USD $5.4 billion in 2024, the market is projected to surge to <strong>USD $7.92 billion in 2025</strong>. This is merely the beginning of a steep ascent. Market analysts forecast a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly <strong>46%</strong> between 2025 and\u00a02034.</p><p>This explosive growth rate means the market size is expected to swell to over <strong>USD $50 billion by 2030</strong> and reach a monumental <strong>USD $236 billion by 2034</strong>. This rapid expansion underscores the technology\u2019s perceived value and the urgency with which businesses are moving to adopt it. The following table synthesizes data from multiple market research reports to provide an authoritative snapshot of this\u00a0trend.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1006/1*OnELDdpPEmU82XV3xftaIg.jpeg\"><h3>Drivers of the Gold\u00a0Rush</h3><p>Several powerful forces are converging to drive this market explosion. These are not just technological trends but fundamental business needs that AI agents are uniquely positioned to\u00a0address.</p><ul><li><strong>Enterprise Hunger for Automation:</strong> The primary driver is the relentless pressure on businesses of all sizes to streamline operations, reduce overhead, and boost efficiency. AI agents directly answer this call by automating not just simple, repetitive tasks but also complex, multi-step workflows that have historically required significant human coordination.</li><li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> In an increasingly competitive landscape, the ability to make fast, informed decisions is a critical advantage. Agents can ingest and analyze vast datasets in real-time, identifying patterns, predicting outcomes, and surfacing insights that were previously inaccessible or took weeks to\u00a0uncover.</li><li><strong>The Scalability Imperative:</strong> AI agents provide a solution to the classic business challenge of scaling operations. Companies can handle massive increases in customer inquiries, data processing, or production demands without a proportional increase in human staff, making agentic AI a crucial tool for sustainable growth and competitiveness.</li></ul><p>These market forces are amplified by a powerful narrative emerging from the highest levels of the corporate world. The astronomical market projections are not occurring in a vacuum; they are directly fueled by a C-suite-driven vision of profound workforce transformation. When influential leaders, such as the CEO of Amazon, publicly state that AI agents will \u201csoon reduce company\u2019s corporate workforce,\u201d it sends a clear signal to investors and the market at large. This narrative reframes the adoption of AI agents from a simple productivity play to a fundamental strategic decision about capital allocation. The message being broadcast to Wall Street is not just \u201cwe\u2019re going to make our employees more efficient,\u201d but rather \u201cwe\u2019re going to spend less on humans\u201d. This is because investors are often more comfortable with capital expenditures on technology, which can be seen as a long-term asset, than with the ongoing operational expenditures of labor costs. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: C-suite promises of cost reduction drive investor enthusiasm and technology spending, which in turn fuels the aggressive market forecasts. This dynamic suggests that the pressure for businesses to adopt AI agents will be immense, driven as much by financial strategy and market expectations as by technological readiness or immediate ROI.</p><h3>The New Workforce: AI Agents on the\u00a0Job</h3><p>As the market for AI agents expands, their application is moving from the theoretical to the practical. Across industries and departments, these digital teammates are being deployed to tackle concrete business challenges, demonstrating tangible returns on investment and fundamentally reshaping workflows.</p><h3>Agents in Every Department</h3><p>The versatility of AI agents allows them to be applied to a wide range of business functions, automating processes and augmenting human capabilities in every corner of the enterprise.</p><ul><li><strong>Finance &amp; Operations:</strong> In the world of finance, where accuracy and timeliness are paramount, agents are proving to be invaluable. <strong>Journal insights agents</strong> can proactively monitor financial transactions, flagging anomalies and potential errors <em>before</em> the critical month-end close process, preventing costly corrections and delays. More advanced <strong>forecasting agents</strong> can synthesize a company\u2019s internal financial data with a continuous stream of external signals\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as market trends, economic indicators, and even weather data\u200a\u2014\u200ato autonomously update financial forecasts in real-time. In operations, <strong>supply chain agents</strong> are creating more resilient systems by monitoring supplier performance, global shipping routes, and geopolitical news to predict and mitigate potential disruptions, automatically rerouting shipments or suggesting alternative suppliers to avoid costly\u00a0delays.</li><li><strong>Human Resources &amp; Talent:</strong> The HR department is being transformed from a support function to a strategic driver of employee experience, powered by agentic AI. Agents can manage the entire hiring pipeline, from writing compelling job descriptions and scheduling interviews to guiding new hires through complex onboarding paperwork and training modules. Beyond administrative tasks, agents are enabling a new level of <strong>personalized employee experience</strong>. They can analyze an employee\u2019s performance and career goals to recommend tailored learning paths, identify individuals who may be at risk of burnout or turnover, and suggest internal mobility opportunities that align with their skills and aspirations. This brings a level of personalized career guidance, traditionally reserved for senior executives, to every employee in the organization.</li><li><strong>Marketing &amp; Sales:</strong> In the fast-paced world of marketing and sales, agents provide a critical edge. <strong>Marketing agents</strong> can analyze market trends and customer behavior to optimize digital advertising campaigns in real-time, automate social media posting schedules, and draft highly personalized email outreach at scale. For sales teams, <strong>intelligent prospecting agents</strong> are a game-changer. They can research potential customers across the web, enrich lead data with information from various sources, and even handle the initial back-and-forth of scheduling a meeting, freeing up human sales professionals to focus on strategic relationship-building and closing\u00a0deals.</li><li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> The contact center is a prime domain for AI agent deployment. By handling repetitive tasks, agents can help address the common workplace challenge of constant interruptions, which 68% of employees report as a barrier to focused work. <strong>Intelligent triage agents</strong> can analyze incoming support tickets for sentiment and urgency, automatically resolving common issues like order tracking or password resets. This allows them to escalate only the most complex or sensitive problems to the right human expert, dramatically improving response times and customer satisfaction.</li></ul><h3>Orchestrating the Workflow: The Rise of the Digital Project\u00a0Manager</h3><p>The true power of agentic AI is realized not when agents work in isolation, but when they collaborate as a cohesive team. While specialized agents excel at specific tasks\u200a\u2014\u200aone for data analysis, another for content creation, a third for customer communication\u200a\u2014\u200atheir true power is unlocked when they work in concert. This creates a new challenge for businesses: how to manage and orchestrate a team of digital\u00a0workers.</p><p>For many professionals and small businesses, the challenge isn\u2019t just using individual AI tools, but orchestrating them into a seamless workflow. This is the problem being tackled by a new class of integrated platforms like <strong>NexusFlow AI</strong>, which acts as a central \u2018digital project manager\u2019 to orchestrate complex workflows, ensuring that specialized agents for design, analysis, and communication are all working in concert towards a single goal. These platforms provide the connective tissue that allows a multi-agent system to function, transforming a collection of individual tools into a powerful, automated process\u00a0engine.</p><p>This evolution from using single tools to orchestrating multi-agent systems highlights a significant paradigm shift. Early business automation focused on discrete, repetitive tasks like data entry. The use cases emerging today demonstrate a clear evolution toward automating entire end-to-end processes. For instance, an agent in the financial sector doesn\u2019t just \u201cverify a document\u201d; it can manage the entire \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) process, from initial identity verification and risk scoring to proactively requesting missing information from the client. This is a move from task automation to process transformation. As consulting firm McKinsey notes, this shift elevates agentic AI from a \u201creactive tool\u201d that enhances individual productivity to a \u201cproactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator\u201d capable of automating and reinventing core business processes. The implication for business leaders is profound: the true return on investment from AI agents will not come from simply layering them on top of existing workflows. It will demand a fundamental reinvention of how work gets done, requiring the redesign of processes and the redefinition of human roles to build an agent-centric organization from the ground up. This is a strategic imperative, not merely a technical upgrade.</p><h3>The Human-Agent Partnership: Promise and\u00a0Peril</h3><p>The integration of AI agents into the global workforce presents a duality of profound promise and significant peril. On one hand, it heralds a new era of unprecedented productivity and innovation. On the other, it raises fundamental questions about job security, ethics, and the very nature of human work. Navigating this complex landscape requires a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the transformative potential and the unavoidable challenges.</p><h3>The Promise: A New Era of Productivity and Innovation</h3><p>The benefits of successfully integrating AI agents are tangible and substantial, touching nearly every aspect of business operations.</p><ul><li><strong>Unprecedented Productivity Gains:</strong> Early adopters are reporting remarkable improvements in efficiency. Across various industries, companies are seeing productivity and speed-to-market gains of <strong>50% or more</strong>. In software development, some organizations have managed to cut development cycles by as much as <strong>60%</strong> while simultaneously reducing production errors by half. More broadly, companies implementing agentic technologies report average revenue increases of 3% to\u00a015%.</li><li><strong>Significant Cost Savings:</strong> By automating manual processes, AI agents dramatically reduce operational expenses. This includes savings on labor costs, as well as the reduction of costly errors inherent in manual work. For example, by using AI agents to streamline its recruiting process, consumer goods giant Unilever reported saving over $1 million annually.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Decision-Making:</strong> AI agents provide business leaders with data-driven insights at a speed and scale previously unimaginable. By analyzing vast datasets in real-time, they empower smarter, faster strategic choices, giving companies a distinct competitive advantage.</li><li><strong>24/7 Availability and Elastic Scalability:</strong> Unlike a human workforce, AI agents can operate continuously, 24/7, without fatigue. They can also scale elastically to meet sudden surges in demand\u200a\u2014\u200aduring a holiday shopping season or a product launch, for instance\u200a\u2014\u200awithout the significant costs and time associated with hiring and training additional human\u00a0staff.</li></ul><h3>The Peril: Navigating the Risks of an Agentic\u00a0Future</h3><p>Alongside these powerful benefits, the rise of AI agents brings a host of significant risks that must be carefully managed.</p><ul><li><strong>Job Displacement and Skill Devaluation:</strong> This is arguably the most pressing societal concern. As agents become capable of automating increasingly complex cognitive tasks, they pose a direct threat to jobs that have historically been safe from automation. This could lead to widespread job displacement and the devaluation of skills, such as routine information analysis, that were once highly compensated.</li><li><strong>Security and Data Privacy:</strong> Granting autonomous agents access to sensitive company data, financial systems, and customer information creates formidable security vulnerabilities. A compromised or poorly designed agent could lead to catastrophic data breaches, financial loss, or operational disruption.</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Bias and Ethical Concerns:</strong> AI agents learn from the data they are trained on. If this data reflects historical societal biases related to race, gender, or other factors, the agents will not only perpetuate but also amplify these biases at scale. This can lead to deeply unfair and discriminatory outcomes in critical areas like hiring, loan applications, and medical diagnoses.</li><li><strong>Overreliance and the Loss of Human Agency:</strong> A growing dependence on automated systems could lead to an atrophy of human critical thinking and oversight skills. The risk of \u201cover-trusting\u201d these systems is substantial, especially as their outputs become more sophisticated and convincing. This could lead to situations where humans fail to catch errors or question flawed, AI-driven decisions.</li></ul><h3>The Human Imperative: The Mandate for Responsible Governance</h3><p>The solution to these profound risks is not to halt technological progress, but to implement robust frameworks for governance and oversight. The core principle must be to keep humans in control. This requires establishing a <strong>\u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d (HITL)</strong> design and deployment process, where human experts monitor every stage of an agent\u2019s lifecycle. Humans must set the agent\u2019s level of autonomy, define its operational boundaries, and retain final approval authority for any sensitive or high-stakes tasks. Furthermore, ethical principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability cannot be an afterthought; they must be embedded into the very architecture of agentic systems from their inception.</p><p>Underlying this entire dynamic is a fundamental tension between the motivations of corporate leadership and the desires of the workforce. On one side, there is a clear executive push for agent adoption, often driven by a desire to cut costs and reduce headcount, as discussed previously. On the other side, there is a more nuanced \u201cworker pull.\u201d A landmark 2025 Stanford study on the future of work found that while a significant portion of the workforce (46.1%) holds positive attitudes toward AI automation, their enthusiasm is highly specific: they want to offload repetitive, tedious, and low-value tasks. The same study revealed that workers harbor significant concerns about AI\u2019s reliability, accuracy, and its inherent lack of human qualities like empathy, creative control, and nuanced judgment. This sets up a potential collision course. Leadership may be incentivized to pursue full automation of roles for maximum cost savings, but the workforce\u200a\u2014\u200aand indeed, the current state of the technology\u200a\u2014\u200ais better suited for a collaborative model of augmentation. This suggests that the most successful and sustainable AI agent implementations will be those that navigate this conflict by focusing on empowering workers and augmenting their capabilities, rather than pursuing outright replacement that is likely to foster resentment and internal resistance.</p><h3>Your Career in the Agentic\u00a0Age</h3><p>The rise of the digital teammate is more than a technological or economic shift; it is a deeply personal one that will reshape career paths, redefine professional roles, and demand a new set of core competencies. For individuals looking to thrive in this new landscape, the key is not to compete with AI agents, but to cultivate the uniquely human skills that complement them.</p><h3>The Great Skill Shift: What\u2019s Your Enduring\u00a0Value?</h3><p>The integration of AI agents into the workplace is triggering a fundamental revaluation of professional skills. A large-scale audit of the U.S. workforce conducted in 2025 reveals a clear and consistent pattern: tasks and skills that are routine, predictable, and information-based are rapidly becoming commodified by automation. In contrast, skills that are interpersonal, creative, and strategic are becoming more valuable than\u00a0ever.</p><p>The research indicates a shrinking demand for what were once considered high-value information-processing skills, such as analyzing data and updating knowledge bases. Simultaneously, there is a growing emphasis on interpersonal and organizational skills, including human interaction, team coordination, teaching, and mentorship. The following table provides a direct, actionable guide for professional development, contrasting the skills being commodified with the enduring human skills that will define value in the Agentic\u00a0Age.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/895/1*MY994-qI0Vk2M7x_zAZPxA.jpeg\"><h3>Managing Your New Digital\u00a0Team</h3><p>For those in leadership and management roles, the nature of the job itself is evolving. The focus is shifting from directly supervising people to orchestrating a hybrid team composed of both human professionals and AI agents. This requires a new set of leadership skills.</p><ul><li><strong>Expert Prompting:</strong> The ability to clearly and effectively articulate goals, constraints, and context to an AI agent will become a core managerial competency. In the near future, a manager\u2019s value and effectiveness may well be measured by \u201chow many digital workers can you manage?\u201d This depends directly on their skill in prompting and directing these\u00a0agents.</li><li><strong>Learning the Boundaries of Trust:</strong> A critical new skill for leaders will be developing the judgment to know when an agent\u2019s output can be trusted and when human intervention is required. This involves understanding the system\u2019s capabilities and limitations and avoiding the dangerous trap of over-trusting an automated process, especially in high-stakes situations.</li><li><strong>Fostering Human Strengths:</strong> The most effective leaders will not try to turn their human team members into more efficient machines. Instead, they will focus on amplifying the skills that agents cannot replicate: creativity, strategic intuition, empathy, and complex problem-solving. Their role will be to create an environment where human talent is liberated by automation, not constrained by\u00a0it.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the research presents two divergent paths for the future of work. One is a path of pure automation, driven by a C-suite narrative of cost-cutting that could lead to widespread job displacement and social disruption. The other is a path of collaboration, where agents are deployed to handle what one expert calls the \u201csuck\u201d out of our jobs\u200a\u2014\u200athe repetitive, boring, and administrative tasks\u200a\u2014\u200athereby freeing humans to focus on more creative, strategic, and meaningful work. The most critical realization is that this outcome is not predetermined. It will be defined by the choices that leaders, developers, and professionals make\u00a0today.</p><p>The Stanford study\u2019s \u201cHuman Agency Scale\u201d (HAS) reveals that for the vast majority of occupations, the ideal scenario desired by workers is neither full human control nor full automation. Instead, it is a collaborative \u201cinverted-U\u201d pattern, where humans and AI work in a balanced partnership. This underscores a powerful conclusion: the future of work is a collaboration, not a replacement, but only if we intentionally design it that way. The responsibility falls on the current generation of professionals to champion a human-centric approach to AI integration, focusing on augmentation that empowers people rather than automation that simply displaces them.</p><h3>Conclusion: Are You Ready for Your Digital Coworker?</h3><p>The evidence is conclusive: AI agents are no longer a futuristic concept but a present-day reality, driving a multi-hundred-billion-dollar economic shift that will touch every industry. They are rapidly evolving beyond simple chatbots to become autonomous \u201cdoers\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aproactive digital teammates capable of understanding goals, creating plans, and executing complex processes across the business landscape. This technological leap presents immense opportunities for unprecedented gains in productivity and innovation, but it is accompanied by significant risks, from job displacement and skill devaluation to profound ethical and security challenges.</p><p>The path forward is not to fear or resist this monumental change, but to actively and thoughtfully shape its integration into our working lives. Success in the emerging Agentic Age will not be defined by our ability to build faster agents, but by our wisdom in forming effective human-agent partnerships. The strategic focus for businesses and individuals alike must shift from a narrow obsession with what tasks we can offload to a broader vision of what we can achieve together. The ultimate goal is to automate the mundane so that we can elevate the meaningful.</p><p>As these digital teammates become more deeply integrated into our daily workflows, the most important question we must ask ourselves is not what tasks we can offload, but what uniquely human work we will choose to\u00a0elevate?</p><h3>Thank you for being a part of the community</h3><p><em>Before you\u00a0go:</em></p><ul><li>Be sure to <strong>clap</strong> and <strong>follow</strong> the writer\u00a0\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\ufe0f<strong>\ufe0f</strong></li><li>Follow us: <a href=\"https://x.com/inPlainEngHQ\"><strong>X</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/inplainenglish/\"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@InPlainEnglish\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://newsletter.plainenglish.io/\"><strong>Newsletter</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7qxylRWKhvZwMz2WuEoua0\"><strong>Podcast</strong></a> |\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitch.tv/inplainenglish\"><strong>Twitch</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://differ.blog/\"><strong>Start your own free AI-powered blog on Differ</strong></a>\u00a0\ud83d\ude80</li><li><a href=\"https://discord.gg/in-plain-english-709094664682340443\"><strong>Join our content creators community on Discord</strong></a>\u00a0\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb</li><li>For more content, visit <a href=\"https://plainenglish.io/\"><strong>plainenglish.io</strong></a> + <a href=\"https://stackademic.com/\"><strong>stackademic.com</strong></a></li></ul><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=245f00261742\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://ai.plainenglish.io/the-agentic-age-how-ais-digital-teammates-are-quietly-remaking-our-careers-companies-and-245f00261742\">The Agentic Age: How AI\u2019s Digital Teammates Are Quietly Remaking Our Careers, Companies, and\u2026</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://ai.plainenglish.io\">Artificial Intelligence in Plain English</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14034",
    "summary": "arXiv:2507.14034v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Agentic AI systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer transformative potential for value co-creation in technical services. However, persistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit their autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide human-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and analogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured taxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within technical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes collaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by the Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the Human-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the framework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the Human-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human approval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows with deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation upon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables discretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key contingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system reliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a systematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human oversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the trade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of safer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.",

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13874",
    "summary": "arXiv:2507.13874v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.13364v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12 different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining strategy and adapted multitask training.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.13814v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation, and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning. Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu, an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically, including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA, step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances students' coding performance.",

We implement a simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun), and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this result.",

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13579",
    "summary": "arXiv:2507.13579v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more transparency and user control in LLM alignment.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.14079v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.",
